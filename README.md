# Atari_environment_sets_for_Goal_driven_learning

* Programming Language: Python
* Contact: Myeong Hyeon Kim (mhkim0314@kaist.ac.kr)
* Function: This program is for setting the Atari game environments inducing goal-driven learning. You can run with main_atari_pygame.py, and generated files will be saved in result_save.

# Before run the code
* need to change "atari_env.py" in atari environment : e.g. "C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python38\site-packages\gym\envs\atari\atari_env.py"
& "rendering.py" in classic control environment. : e.g. "C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python38\site-packages\gym\envs\classic_control\rendering.py"
* If you want to see the effect of state-transition uncertainty, change the uncertainty variables.
